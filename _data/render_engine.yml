    Interested in projects that use proprietary engines, Unreal Engine, DirectX, Vulkan, Metal, GNMX/GNM, etc.

    **For the past 2 years, Iâ€™ve been actively working with graphics APIs and game engines.**
    I started with OpenGL/GLSL, and for the last six months, I've been working with DirectX 12/HLSL.

            Worked on oil-and-gas industry projects: a math library and a desktop application. 
            
            + Implemented a Spline Renderer module using OpenGL ES / GLSL that allows to render SVG images of drill string modules along 
            curved drilling trajectories, enabling more accurate visual representation on engineering diagrams.
            + Optimized 2D and 3D graphics and diagrams by using data batching for GPU submission and implementing 
            a system similar to LOD/Culling for rendered objects.
            + Developed an integration that compiles C# sources into a set of .NET assemblies and uses nethost/hostfxr 
            to execute C# CIL from within a C++ process. This enabled the integration of a large mathematical library written in C#,
            which was used to implement a rare set of features that significantly increased the software's marketability and attracted new users.
            
            Tech stack: C++, Qt, OpenGL ES, GLSL, CMake, C++/CLI, Win32 API, Conan, SWIG, Google Test, WSL, Linux, hostfxr/nethost

            Worked on a U.S. repossession industry project, primarily back-end services of a large ecosystem. 
            
            + Parallelized the main business process of the service by breaking it into parts that run as separate processes, 
            with the ability to scale the number of processes individually for each client and distribute process execution across multiple servers. 
            This effectively allowed for infinite scaling.
            + Integrated Okta OAuth authorization, enabling centralized user management across all services.
            
            Tech stack: PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis, SendGrid, OpenSearch Amazon S3

        Currently, I'm developing my own **graphics engine built entirely on DirectX 12**.
        So far, it includes: Deferred Rendering, Light Volume-based lighting, Shadow Mapping, Normal Mapping, Emission, HDR/Gamma correction.
        I use RenderDoc and Nsight Systems/Graphics for debugging and profiling. The build process is fully automated with CMake, 
        which downloads all necessary dependencies (including the Agility SDK). There is an NVTX3 integration that provides advanced support for NVIDIA Nsight Systems/Graphics.

  title: References
  description: |
    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
